Bevy is built by volunteers. If you want to help us build the next great game engine, [please reach out](/community)! We need all the help we can get:

* If you are a software developer and you want to help out, check out the [Contributing Code](/learn/quick-start/contributing/code) section.
* If you are good at teaching or writing, consider [contributing to our docs](/learn/quick-start/contributing/docs).

We want Bevy to be a vibrant developer community ... thats actually why we chose the name! A Bevy is a group of birds, just like we are a group of game developers. Join the Bevy!
